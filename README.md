-Description :
The purpose of this rush is to show you the (infinite?) features of the two mammoths of text editing: emacs and vim. Today, you will move beyond the old quarrels and use both! The opportunity to get rid of your stereotypes (trade them for certitudes, that's better), on the one hand, and on the other hand, never again to have to ask how you get out of this ****** editor opened by mistake, for god's sake.
